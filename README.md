<h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
<p>1. Unable to retrieve JSON file from the given link. I ran into a CORS error and did not know how to resolve it/work around it. Ended up putting the JSON file into a local db.json folder and running a local json-server.</p>
<p>2. Able to read data from JSON-server however I am unable to manipulate the data. json file consistently appeared to be null whenever I tried to iterate over the data. (Possibly lacking async, await function)</p>
<p>3. Spent most of my time trying to code the deliverables, not having enough time to beautify the website.</p>
